# Cascaded_VLM
This repo contains code that uses CNN-based model as a preprocessing step for VLM model, which will provide grounding for laguage model and perform better on vqa tasks as per our assumtion.

We choose YoloV11 as out preprocessing vision model for its computational efficiency and accuracy.

The whole pipeline of proposed idea is depicted in Figure 1.
